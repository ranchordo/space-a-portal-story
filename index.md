# FAQ
### What the heck is this?
Space - A Portal Story is a community-made portal game building on the events of Portal and Portal 2, and continuing with Chell as the main character where Portal 2 left off. Several new game mechanics involving gravity will be introduced and used in many puzzles throughout the game.
### What will this game be about?
This project is currently very early in development. Storyline details are not fully fleged out yet, and will not be made available on this website until the release of our trailer, currently scheduled to release in the 21st century (maybe).<br>In short, \[REDACTED\] for now.
### Is this a mod of Portal 2?
Nope! Space - A Portal Story will use a brand new engine called [Lepton](https://github.com/ranchordo/lepton), which is written by us in Java and designed to be as cross-platform as possible. Consequently, we will be able to give players Steam achievements.
### Will this have a cooperative testing program?
Currently no, but things may change.
### What can I do with the music or source code?
Space - A Portal Story will be released as open-source, along with all game files (and things like project files), <em>when it releases</em>. Please check the license files in those releases for more details, but you will pretty much be able to use all files as long as you mention where you got them from. You can currently track some of our progress on our [Github repo](https://github.com/ranchordo/space-a-portal-story).

# Space: A Portal Story  
This is the source of an upcoming community-made portal game with the same name (see <https://ranchordo.github.io/space-a-portal-story>).  
This software requires [Lepton](https://github.com/ranchordo/lepton) and [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) in order to build correctly.
  
"resources" needs to be added to the build path. It consists of assets that need to be packaged with the executable (shaders, etc). "assets" needs to be in the same directory as the jar or source, but cannot be added to the build path.

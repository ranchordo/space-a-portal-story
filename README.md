# Space: A Portal Story  
This is the source of an upcoming community-made portal game with the same name (see <http://aportalstory.space>).  
The decision to not include a license was intentional and was not an oversight. See more detailed information about your permissions below.  
This program requires LWJGL-3.2.3 with the following bindings:  
1. LWJGL core  
2. LWJGL-OpenGL  
3. LWJGL-GLFW  
4. LWJGL-OpenAL  
4. LWJGL-STB  
4. LWJGL-OpenVR  
*Right now this repo is private.* I will make it public when the game is released. If I do that and forget to delete this, apologies.
